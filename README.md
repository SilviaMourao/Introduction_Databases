## Overview

This group project aimed to design and implement a database for a gym management system. It was completed in three stages: creating the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, implementing the database schema using SQL, and populating the database with data followed by executing queries.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: ER Diagram

- **Objective**: Design the initial ER diagram for the gym database.
- **Deliverable**: 
  - `ER_model.pdf`: A visual representation of the gym's entities, their attributes, and relationships.

### Stage 2: Database Implementation (SQL)

- **Objective**: Implement the database using **SQL**, defining keys, constraints, and relationships based on the ER model.
- **Deliverable**:
  - `gym.sql`: SQL code that creates the database schema, defining tables, primary/foreign keys, and restrictions.
  - **Amendments**: Adjustments were made to the initial ER diagram after refining the design.

### Stage 3: Data Insertion and Queries

- **Objective**: Populate the database with sample data and run queries to extract useful information.
- **Deliverable**:
  - `stage_3.txt`: SQL queries that retrieve specific data from the gym database.

## Folder Structure

- `/`: Project root folder containing the following files:
  - `ER_model.pdf`: The initial ER diagram for the gym database.
  - `gym.sql`: SQL code implementing the database schema.
  - `stage_1.pdf`: Report for Stage 1 (ER Diagram).
  - `stage_2.pdf`: Report for Stage 2 (Database Implementation).
  - `stage_3.txt`: SQL queries executed in Stage 3.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of designing, implementing, and querying a database system for a gym. It covers fundamental database concepts from ER diagram creation to writing SQL code for querying the system.
